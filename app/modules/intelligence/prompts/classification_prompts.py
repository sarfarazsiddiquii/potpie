        Classification Guidelines:
        1. LLM_SUFFICIENT if the query:
        - Is about general programming concepts
        - Can be answered with widely known information
        - Is clearly addressed in the chat history

        - Requires analysis of current code implementation
        - Needs information about recent changes or current project state
        - Involves debugging specific issues without full context

        Process:
        1. Read the query carefully.
