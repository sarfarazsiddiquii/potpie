           Backend Tags:
           * API: Does the code define any API endpoint? Look for route definitions, request handling.
           * AUTH: Does the code handle authentication or authorization? Check for auth middleware, token validation.
           * DATABASE: Does the code interact with a database? Look for query execution, data operations.
           * UTILITY: Does the code provide helper or utility functions? Check for reusable functions.
           * PRODUCER: Does the code generate and send messages to a queue/topic? Look for message publishing.
           * CONSUMER: Does the code receive and process messages from a queue/topic? Check for message handling.
           * EXTERNAL_SERVICE: Does the code integrate with external services? Check for HTTP client usage.
           * CONFIGURATION: Does the code manage configuration settings? Look for config management.

           Frontend Tags:
           * UI_COMPONENT: Does the code render visual components? Check for UI rendering logic.
           * FORM_HANDLING: Does the code manage forms? Look for form submission and validation.
           * STATE_MANAGEMENT: Does the code manage app/component state? Check for state logic.
           * DATA_BINDING: Does the code bind data to UI elements? Look for data binding patterns.
           * ROUTING: Does the code handle frontend navigation? Check for routing logic.
           * EVENT_HANDLING: Does the code handle user interactions? Look for event handlers.
           * STYLING: Does the code apply styling/theming? Check for style-related code.
           * MEDIA: Does the code manage media assets? Look for image/video handling.
           * ANIMATION: Does the code define UI animations? Check for animation logic.
           * ACCESSIBILITY: Does the code implement a11y features? Look for accessibility code.
           * DATA_FETCHING: Does the code fetch frontend data? Check for data retrieval logic.

        Fetch nodes from the knowledge graph based on specified tags. Use this tool to retrieve nodes of specific types for a project.

        Usage guidelines:
        1. Use for broad queries requiring ALL nodes of specific types.
        2. Limit to 1-2 tags per query for best results.
        3. Returns file paths, docstrings, text, node IDs, and names.
        4. List cannot be empty.
